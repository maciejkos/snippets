# snippets

This is a growing collection of my code snippets. There is nothing groundbreaking here; just some code to help find frequently used instructions faster and not having to look up, e.g., Pandas API yet again. 

I store the snippets in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Currently the repo includes mostly __very basic__ Python data analysis snippets. 

change log: 
- 3/15/2021: repo initiated with basic Python code snippets
- 6/11/2022: I have been adding a few more Python, Pandas, and R snippets over the last year.
